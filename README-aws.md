Configuring buckets for AWS S3
------------------------------

In general, we will configure two types of buckets:

- One or more private buckets to be used for storing badges, grades,
  videos and Open Response Assessment (aka ORA2)
  files. `S3_STORAGE_BUCKET`, `S3_FILE_UPLOAD_BUCKET`, and
  `S3_GRADE_BUCKET` should be set to use these types of buckets.
- A public bucket, used only for `S3_PROFILE_IMAGE_BUCKET` to contain
  profile images.

### Private Bucket

#### Bucket creation

Create a new bucket in the AWS S3 console with the settings below:

1. `Bucket name`: my-openedx-bucket-name
2. `AWS Region`: no need to change
3. `Object Ownership`: ACLs disabled (recommended)
4. `Block Public Access settings for this bucket`: Block all public
   access
5. `Bucket Versioning`: Disable
6. `Tags`: It is optional
7. `Default encryption`: Disable
8. Then click on: **Create bucket**

#### Bucket Permissions

`tutor-contrib-s3` will use pre-signed URLs to communicate with
private buckets. Therefore we need to configure the bucket to allow
Open edX to access (`GET`) and upload (`PUT`) the files only from the
domain your Open edX instance is hosted on.

Access the Bucket Permissions tab and change the setting below (make
sure values `LMS_HOST` and `CMS_HOST` are replaced with correct
URLs.):

**Cross-origin resource sharing** (CORS):

```json
[
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": [
            "Content-disposition",
            "Content-type",
            "X-CSRFToken"
        ],
        "AllowedMethods": [
            "GET",
            "PUT"
        ],
        "AllowedOrigins": [
            "https://${LMS_HOST}",
            "https://${CMS_HOST}"
        ],
        "ExposeHeaders": [],
        "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
    }
]
```

### Profile Pictures Bucket

Open edX will store user profile images in this bucket. These files
are accessed by a simple URL without any authentication. Here is an
example of such a URL:  
`https://my-openedx-profile-images.s3.amazonaws.com/openedx/media/profile-images/1c7864143410dfadbbc267fe4593806a_50.jpg?v=1650476461`

#### Bucket creation

Create a new bucket in the AWS S3 console with the settings below:

1. `Bucket name`: openedx-profile-pictures-bucket
2. `AWS Region`: no need to change
3. `Object Ownership`: ACLs disabled (recommended)
4. `Block Public Access settings for this bucket`: Uncheck "Block all
   public access"
5. `Bucket Versioning`: Disable
6. `Tags`: It is optional
7. `Default encryption`: Disable
8. Then click: **Create bucket**

#### Bucket Permissions

We need to configure the bucket to allow Open edX to access (`GET`)
the files using a simple URL but only from the domain your Open edX
instance is hosted on. Also give full access (read, write, delete,
list) to the backend user account (authenticated with
`OPENEDX_AWS_ACCESS_KEY` and `OPENEDX_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`).

Access the Bucket Permissions tab and change the configurations below:

**Bucket policy**:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "openedxWebAccess",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject*",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::${AWS_PROFILE_BUCKET_NAME}/*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "openedxBackendAccess",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}:user/${AWS_IAM_USER}"
            },
            "Action": "s3:*",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::${AWS_PROFILE_BUCKET_NAME}/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Note**: Make sure you replace `AWS_PROFILE_BUCKET_NAME`,
`AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` and `AWS_IAM_USER` with correct values.

**Cross-origin resource sharing** (CORS):

```json
[
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": [],
        "AllowedMethods": [
            "GET"
        ],
        "AllowedOrigins": [
            "https://${LMS_HOST}",
            "https://${CMS_HOST}"
        ],
        "ExposeHeaders": [],
        "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
    }
]
```

**Note**: Replace `LMS_HOST` and `CMS_HOST` with URLs of your LMS and
CMS.

### Examples of variable values:
* `LMS_HOST`: openedx.com
* `CMS_HOST`: studio.openedx.com
* `AWS_PROFILE_BUCKET_NAME`: openedx-profile-pictures-bucket
* `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`: 123456789012
* `AWS_IAM_USER`: openedx-user

## CloudFront

If you need to accelerate website content delivery, another option to
serve the profile pictures is to use
[CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) in front of AWS S3.

Amazon CloudFront is a fast content delivery network
([CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network))
service that securely delivers data to customers globally with low
latency and high transfer speeds.

CloudFront caches the data and sends it to the user from the nearest
edge location, instead of picking it from the original location (S3
Bucket). This speeds up the transfer rate.

For more information follow [this
guide](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudfront-serve-static-website/).

If you use this alternative, you must set
`S3_PROFILE_IMAGE_CUSTOM_DOMAIN` to your CloudFront distribution
domain name, e.g.: `d31h0g0s5c5qjp.cloudfront.net`.
